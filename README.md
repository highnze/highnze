### Hej 🙃

- 🔭 I’m currently working at the [University of Kassel](https://www.uni-kassel.de/uni/) in the [department of Experimental and Digital Design and Construction](https://www.uni-kassel.de/fb06/institute/architektur/fachgebiete/experimentelles-und-digitales-entwerfen-und-konstruieren/home) as a research asssociate, where I am researching and experimenting around the topic of robot-assisted additive manufacturing of components from waste wood particles.

- 🤖 You can find my final thesis "Alexa allein Zuhaus" in Systemdesign at www.alexaalleinzuhaus.de and in my [respo](https://github.com/highnze/alexaalleinzuhaus.de)

- 🍃 I like to go climbing 🧗‍♀️ , riding my bike 🚴‍♀️ and I am always on the lookout for the latest sweets 🍪
